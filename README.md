# TMC_GAN

Our TMC-GAN framework integrates three key components: Temporal dependencies through Transformer-based encoding, Multi-scale global indicators via dedicated processing pathways, and Cyclical patterns using frequency-domain analysis. The framework employs adversarial training to generate robust market predictions by learning the complex dynamics of financial time series.
